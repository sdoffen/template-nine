# Template9 API Design Project

### Instructions

*This repository should be set up before connecting your Postman project to GitHub.*

1. Update the `CODEOWNERS` file to reflect the correct set of contributors
2. Remove the instructions from this README and replace it with a description of the API
3. Push the changes with the commit message "Initial commit"
4. Add a branch protection rule for the `main` branch with the following characteristics:
    - Require a PR before merging
        - Require approvals
        - Require review from Code Owners
        - Require approval of the most recent reviewable push
    - Require conversation resolution before merging
    - Require linear history
    - Do not allow bypassing the above settings

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you do not check the box for **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**, then Postman will allow for pushing directly to the main branch, even if you have **Require a PR before merging** checked.

5. Connect Postman to this repository.
